This repository include the source code of the Efficient Container Tag

The basic taint analysis framework and angora tag are from [libdft64](https://github.com/AngoraFuzzer/libdft64)

The BDD package is from [sylvan](https://github.com/trolando/sylvan)

The ewah tag is from [vuzzer64](https://github.com/vusec/vuzzer64)

Attention! Although our scheme is based on BDD, in the source code our
tag name is ssa tag. this is due to the fact that bdd tag is already used by angora
